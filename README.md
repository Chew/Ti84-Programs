# Ti-84+ Programs & Games
Programs (and maybe games) for your Ti-84+ Calculator

**NOTE: These were all made on a Ti-84+CE so they may not work as well on older models.**

You can now view the Ti-84 Programs on the beautiful new website! Check the website by clicking [here](http://ti84.chewcraft.me).

Slowly I will try to move all the program info there, too, as well as the install guide.

##How to Install any of my programs

####Both of these methods requires your calculator's Ti-Connect software, refer to your booklet to see which is needed. I will be using the guide and images for the Ti-Connect CE, yours may be different
