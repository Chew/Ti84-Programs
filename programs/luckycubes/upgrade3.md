# How to upgrade to 3.0 from 2.0

If you never played during 2.0, you don't need this guide.

## Why is this?

The way I implemented a proper new game and load game requires something to be stored in the 1st list item.

In 2.0, this is already holding cubes, so upon running 3.0 would break your cube count.

I upped all the numbers by 1, so everything would be one off.

## How fix?

Download [this program](LCVARFIX.8xp).

Run it, let it fix.

EZ done.

## That's all, to fix?

Yep.

## Cool.

Enjoy 3.0!
