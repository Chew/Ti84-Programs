- Cost to buy cubes now shows how many coins you have.
- Successful cube purchase shows your coin and cube count.
- Insufficient funds shows how many coins you still need.
- Re-worked how you get coins from mercenaries.

- Collecting coins from mercenaries now shows your total coins.
- Purchasing a mercenary now shows how many coins and mercenaries you have.
- Purchasing a mercenary has a "Buy Again" button, so you're able to essentially spam the enter button to buy a ton of mercenaries.
