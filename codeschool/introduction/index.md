# Ti-84 Code School - Introduction

Hello! Welcome to Ti-84 Code-School. Here you will learn how to code your very own Ti-84 programs!

We will start very basic, but work our way up to exciting games!

Remember that this is only my knowledge, there is still so much more to learn! So explore, let this be a guide!

**As the lessons are being written, things are subject to change, be sure to check back often for improvements**

All lessons will be introduced as a walkthrough! So pull out your Ti-84 and start coding!
