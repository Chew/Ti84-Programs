# Lesson 1 - The Basics: Learn how to start and run a program.

Grab your calculators and let's get started.

## Step 1: Creating a new program

First, we need to create a new program. Press the `prgm` button on your calculator. It is found above the `cos` button and below the `stat` button.

Now, press the right arrow twice, OR left arrow once. You should now be on the "New" tab of the Menu. Go ahead and press enter to confirm a new program.

Now, we need to pick a name! Feel free to call it whatever you like, for now we will name it "LESSON1".

#### TIP: Not sure how to type? Above most keys is a green alphabet letter, this indicates the letter it will type if pressed. By default, pressing it will only trigger that key, if you press ALPHA, the cursor will have an "A" in the middle, this means you're in typing mode, press `ALPHA` to toggle this. When we name it, the A is there automatically.

For example, to type L-E-S-S-O-N, we would press the keys: `)`, `sin`, `ln`, `ln`, `7`, `log`. Pressing the `ALPHA` key will turn off the keyboard, so press it and just type the number `1`.

Now we can get started!

## Step 2: Editing the Program

The menu you see is a blank program. Nothing too interesting, right? This is your scriping page, similar to text editors like Notepad++ and Sublime Text, this is the Ti-84's.

Let's type in a normal equation, such as 2+2. If we were to run it, the calculator would solve this equation and give us the answer.

#### TIP: The editor is in CLASSIC mode, if you have an old Ti-84 without a backlit display, this is an example of a CLASSIC calculator. On a Ti-84+CE, MATHPRINT is used by default. MP for short, typing something like a square root has a box you can type in, but on CLASSIC, you must type after it.

## Step 3: Running the Program

Well, let's go ahead and run this 2+2! Press the `2nd` key, on the top right of your calculator, under `y=`, then press the button to the right, `mode`. You will exit the editor.

Now you're back on the main menu! Go ahead and press `prgm` key and you should now see your program! 

#### Note: My calculator has way too many programs on it, so I will provide a picture later.

Press the down arrow key once (or until it is on the program you just made) and press enter. You should now be on the main menu with "prgmLESSON1" (or whatever you named it) in the box.

Go ahead and press enter again to run the program, the output should be 4.

## Step 4: Editing an existing program.

Go ahead and press `pgrm`. Instead of running the program, press the right arrow once, now you're on the "EDIT" tab. Press the down arrow until you have your program selected, and press `enter`. You should see your 2+2 code! You may now modify and run the program by accessing step 3.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! What did you learn in this lesson?

1) How to create, modify, and run a program!

2) How to type using the APLHA keyboard!

## Things to try:

1) Try other equations, do they work too?

2) Try creating another program but with a different equation. Make sure it is a different name!
