# Lesson 2 - Inputs and Outputs

[Introduction](http://ti84.chew.pw/codeschool/introduction) |
[Previous Lesson](http://ti84.chew.pw/codeschool/lesson/1) |
[Next Lesson](http://ti84.chew.pw/codeschool/lesson/3)

This lesson assumes the following:

1) That you know how to create, run, and edit a program. Not sure how? [Follow this tutorial here](http://ti84.chew.pw/codeschool/lesson/1).

You will learn:

1) The Disp, Input, and Prompt functions.

2) How to add a function to the editor.

After this lesson, it will be assumed that you know how to type on the Ti-84 keyboard.

## Step 1: Implementing the Disp Function

Our first function! So what does the Disp exactly does it do? The Disp function shows a line of text. Let's try it out.

Go ahead and make a new program and name it. I'm going to name it "LESSON2", but feel free to name it whatever you like.

To access the Disp function, while in the editor, press the `prgm` button. You'll notice that you do not see your program names, but instead a list of functions. We haven't learned what these are yet, so go ahead and ignore them.

![lesson2pic1](http://files.chew.pw/ticodeschool/lesson2pic1.png)

You can also see that we are in a tab called "CTL", we do not need this yet! Press the right arrow once to navigate to the "I/O" tab.

Here we see a lot of other functions we don't quite know how to use yet. One of these is the Disp function!

![lesson2pic2](http://files.chew.pw/ticodeschool/lesson2pic2.png)

You can either press the `3` key here or press the down arrow *2* times and press enter. The Disp function is now in our editor!

We can display a Letter Variable, such as a letter A-Z, a string variable, a list or list number, or some simple text.

#### TIP: The Disp function shows numbers on the right, and string/letters on the left.

## Step 2: Using the Disp Function

Let's test a letter variable, and a word variable. Go ahead and press the `ALPHA` key, then the `math` key, the letter A will appear.

![lesson2pic3](http://files.chew.pw/ticodeschool/lesson2pic3.png)

Go ahead and run the program (Forgot? Press `2nd` then `mode`, `pgrm` down arrow until selected, `enter` twice). If you have not defined any variables, it should show the number 0.

![lesson2pic4](http://files.chew.pw/ticodeschool/lesson2pic4.png)

Yay! It works.

Now let's try a string of text. Go ahead and go back into the code editor for this program.

Press the Enter button once until your cursor is below the first Disp function.

![lesson2pic5](http://files.chew.pw/ticodeschool/lesson2pic5.png)

Go ahead and add another Disp function.

To implement a string of text, we must first add a quotation mark. To add a quotation mark, press the `alpha` key, then press the plus key.

![lesson2pic6](http://files.chew.pw/ticodeschool/lesson2pic6.png)

Let's put a very simple string, such as "HELLO WORLD"

#### TIP: By default every letter is capital, there is a way to enable lower-case, but we'll learn that later.

We can use alpha lock to enable typing only, just like it was when naming a program. To enable alpha-lock, press the 2nd key, then the ALPHA key.

To type a space, we can simply press the 0 key. The green character above it looks similar to a smiley face.

So let's type HELLO WORLD! Press these keys: `^`, `sin`, `)`, `)`, `7`, `0`, `-`, `7`, `x` (multiply), `)`, `x-1` (found to the left of sin)

#### TIP: You do NOT need to put a quotation mark at the end!

![lesson2pic7](http://files.chew.pw/ticodeschool/lesson2pic7.png)

Alright! Now we see "HELLO WORLD" in our editor. Let's see what happens if we run it?

Exit the editor and run the program again. Since we just recently ran the program, it should be the first thing in our history, so we can just press enter to run it, skipping the prgm menu.

The output should look like this.

## Step 3: Accepting User Input

Let's ask the user for an input, and let's also give their response back, as an example.

Go back into the editor and press enter 2 times to start a new line on the button, then open up the function menu (press prgm). Again, navigate to the I/O tab.

#### NOTE: Unlike typical editors, pressing enter does not move the program down lines, we will learn how to push the lines down later.

Let's start with the Input method, this method accepts input and can be placed into a letter variable or string variable, for now we will use a letter variable.

Go ahead and press enter to confirm your Input function.

![lesson2pic9](http://files.chew.pw/ticodeschool/lesson2pic9.png)

The Input function takes the input and puts it into the variable you choose. Let's set the input to variable A.

Go ahead and press ALPHA then math to have the user input be entered into variable A.

Let's also add another Disp A function below it.

![lesson2pic10](http://files.chew.pw/ticodeschool/lesson2pic10.png)

Go ahead and exit the editor and press enter to run it (since the progra, is still the first thing in the history)

When we run it, we see the program has paused, and we see a "?" with the cursor after it. This is the program waiting for an input!

![lesson2pic11](http://files.chew.pw/ticodeschool/lesson2pic11.png)

Let's type in a simple number, like the number 2. Type 2 into the program, just like an equation, then press enter to continue.

The program will now say "2" since we asked it to display the variable A. The Input method changed the variable A to our input!

We can also enter equations! Run the program again, but this time, type "2+2" into the program. The output should be 4!

## Conclusion

Congratulation! What did you learn this lesson?

1) How to add a function.

2) How to use the Disp function to show a variable and a string of text.

3) How to accept user input.

## Things to Try

1) Try other input letter variables, such as B, or Z.

2) Make a program that greets the user, on another line, ask for some information about them, such as their age, and display it back to them.
